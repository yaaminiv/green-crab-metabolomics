This legend elaborates on the data stored in the "Status" column of the log files. Example: NotOK(3,9)

0. N/A
1. N/A
2. Detector saturated. Reduction of ambient light (e.g. lamp, sunlight) necessary.
3. Reference signal intensity too low (<20mV). Contact info@pyroscience.com for support
4. Reference signal too high (>2400mV). Contact info@pyroscience.com for support
5. Failure of sample temperature sensor (Pt100). Either no sensor is connected or the sensor is broken.
6. N/A
7. High humidity (>90%RH). The device can get permanently damaged in condensing conditions. Reduce humidity in the environment of the device.
8. Failure of case temperature sensor. Contact info@pyroscience.com for support
9. Failure of pressure sensor. Contact info@pyroscience.com for support
10. Failure of humidity sensor. Contact info@pyroscience.com for support
11. Sensor intensity too low for reliable measurements.
12. Sensor intensity too low for reliable measurements. Probably no sensor connected.
13. pH sensor out of specified range for this sensor type.
14. Too much ambient light reaches the detector. Please reduce ambient light for reliable measurements.
