# Respirometry

Methods for measuring oxygen consumption of crabs.

## Materials

- FireSting respirometry equipment (sensors, PC computer, and charger cord)
- 4 respirometry chambers with oxygen sensor spots, probe holders, and lids. Chambers and lids should be glass and covered with dark material (ex. trash bag)
- 4 similar chambers covered with dark material for acclimation
- Mesh
- Rubber bands
- Parafilm
- Weights
- Refractometer

## Methods

### Acclimate crabs

1. Set up a tank at the appropriate temperature for acclimation.
2. Turn off lights in tanks and identify crabs for respirometry assay.
3. Place crabs in acclimation chambers and cover with mesh. Secure mesh with a rubber band.
4. Put crabs in acclimation tank and crabs in the chambers for an hour.

### Set up FireSting (repeat between each set of measurements)

5. Wipe resiprometry chambers with 70% ethanol and air dry
6. Obtain FireSting and PC computer with software. Plug in O<sub>2</sub> meter, O<sub>2</sub> probes, and temperature probe. For each probe that's plugged in, change the settings (gear button) to measure percent oxygen saturation and calibrate the upper limit with ambient air.

### Run assay

7. Start logging a new session.
8. Remove crabs from acclimation chambers and place in respirometry chambers. Fill chambers with aerated water from the tank so it's slightly above the chamber. Cover immediately with parafilm and secure with the lid and weight to prevent oxygen intrusion.
9. Quickly place respirometry chambers in the experimental tank.
10. Start data collection. Measure until oxygen saturation dips between 70-75% (about 30 minutes at 15ÂºC).
11. Once oxygen saturation is between 70-75%, remove the crab from the container and quickly reseal the chamber, avoiding any bubbles.
12. Measure background respiration in the chamber for as long as the crab's respiration was measured. After measuring background respiration, stop logging.
13. While measuring, obtain salinity measurement from experimental tank. Blot and weigh crabs that were measured.
14. Save data session to appropriate folder on PC. Move data files to separate machine and/or Google Drive as a back-up.
