# Respirometry

Methods for measuring oxygen consumption of crabs.

## Materials

- FireSting respirometry equipment (sensors, PC computer, and charger cord)
- 4 respirometry chambers with oxygen sensor spots, probe holders, and lids. Chambers and lids should be covered with dark material (ex. trash bag)
- 4 similar chambers covered with dark material for acclimation
- Mesh
- Rubber bands
- Parafilm
- Weights
- Refractometer

## Methods

### Acclimate crabs

1. Turn off lights in tanks.
2. Identify crabs for respirometry assay. Temporarily place all other crabs in another tank of the same temperature to make room for the respirometry chambers.
3. Place crabs in acclimation chambers in the experimental tanks and cover with mesh. Secure mesh with a rubber band.
4. Acclimate crabs in the chambers for an hour.

### Set up FireSting (only do this once per day of respirometry)

5. Obtain FireSting and PC computer with software. Plug in O<sub>2</sub> meter, O<sub>2</sub> probes, and temperature probe. For each probe that's plugged in, change the settings (gear button) to measure percent oxygen saturation and calibrate the upper limit with ambient air.
6. Start logging a new session
7. Wipe resiprometry chambers with 70% ethanol and air dry

### Run assay

8. Remove crabs from acclimation chambers and place in respirometry chambers. Fill chambers with aerated water from the tank so it's slightly above the chamber. Cover immediately with parafilm and secure with the lid and weight to prevent oxygen intrusion.
9. Quickly place respirometry chambers in the experimental tank and attach FireSting probes
10. Start data collection. Measure until oxygen saturation dips below 80% (about 30 minutes at 15ÂºC).
11. Once oxygen saturation is below 80%, remove the crab from the container and quickly reseal the chamber, avoiding any bubbles.
12. Measure background respiration in the chamber for as long as the crab's respiration was measured. After measuring background respiration, stop logging.
13. While measuring, obtain salinity measurement from experimental tank. Blot and weigh crabs that were measured.
14. Save data session to appropriate folder on PC. Move data files to separate machine and/or Google Drive as a back-up.
