# Time-to-Right

Methods for time-to-right assay adapted from [Young et al. (2006)](doi.org/10.1007/s00300-006-0140-7)

## Materials

- Stop watch
- Data sheet

## Methods

1. Identify crab for righting assay
2. Place crab upside-down with dorsal surface on the bottom of the tank. Be sure to keep the crab in the same temperature conditions as the tank it is in.
3. Time how long it takes for the crab to right itself using the stop watch. The behavior stars with the fifth pair of pereopods moving anteriorlyh and dorsally, and ends with the dactyls of the second pair of pereopods touch the tank bottom. Record the time in seconds. If the crab takes longer than 120 seconds (two minutes), then record the time as 120+ and move onto the next step.
4. Rest for 10 seconds and repeat two more times for a total of three measurements per crab.
