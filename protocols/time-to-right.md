# Time-to-Right

Methods for time-to-right assay adapted from [Young et al. (2006)](doi.org/10.1007/s00300-006-0140-7)

## Materials

- Stop watch
- Data sheet

## Methods

1. Identify crab for righting assay
2. Place crab upside-down with dorsal surface on the bottom of the tank and start the stop watch
3. Time how long it takes for the crab to right itself using the stop watch. Record the time in seconds. If the crab takes longer than 90 seconds (two minutes), then record the time as 91 and move onto the next step. *Note: The specific righting behavior stars with the fifth pair of pereopods moving anteriorlyh and dorsally, and ends with the dactyls of the second pair of pereopods touch the tank bottom. However, we are including hesitation time in our measurements for time-to-right*
4. Rest for 10 seconds and repeat two more times for a total of three measurements per crab.
